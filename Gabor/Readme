Description	
First function named "gaborFilterBank" generates a custom-sized Gabor filter bank. It creates a u*v array, whose elements are m by n matrices; each matrix being a 2-D Gabor filter. 
Second function named "gaborFeatures" extracts the Gabor features of the image. 
It creates a column vector, consisting of the image's Gabor features. 
At the end of each file there is a Show section that plots the filters and shows the filtered images. These are only for illustration purpose, and you can comment them as you wish.
